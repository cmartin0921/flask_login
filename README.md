# Flask Log In Template
This is a simple template of a login Rest API. The reason for small exercise is to give me an excuse to learn Flask as I've been meaning to do some backend work in Python. This has password encryption as well as validation for the passed resource. All of my testing was done through [PostMan](https://www.getpostman.com/).
